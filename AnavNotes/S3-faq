S3-FAQ
1. S3 Standard and Standard IA ,Glacier storage provides the 99.999999999 durability (11 nines )

2. Also provide Access control ,Versioning ,CORS and backup etc.

3. When storing the objects in s3 it store in different devices and in different facilities before returning success to upload.

4. Checksum using MD5 and cycle redundancy check (CRS’s) to detect the data corruption .Amazon performs these checks on data at rest fixed using redundant data to maintain integrity of data.

5. Versioning is extra layer of durability and you can preservee ,retrieve and retain any version of data

6. By default it returns the latest copy ,to get the overwritten or deleted data you can mention version and retrieve it .

7. When user deletes the objects it will not be available for subsequent request (unversioned) but previous version will be preserved.

8. User can create the rollback window using lifecycle of storing into glacier and delete after 100 days so rollback window is 100 days by saving storage costs also.

9. Versioning MFA delete provide maximum protection of my preserve data. So was account credential and MFA token to delete anything

10. S3 Standard IA class is for Infrequent access data with high speed and low latency and wit low code of receive and storage per Gb.

11. S3 standard IA perform same performance as compared to S3 Standard

12. Standard IA provide 99.9% avialablity.

13. You can directly add the objects by specifying the STANDARD_IA in X-Ams-Storage-Class header or use the lifecycle policy to mover from standard to Standard IA

14. latancy and through will be same standard class

15. Although it is for long lived data but data should be there standard IA for minimum 30days otherwise it will be charged for full 30 days.min limit is 30 days

16. Minimum size for Standard IA is 128kb ,whatever be the size less than 128 kb you have to pay for 128 kb

17. Glacier is even more cheaper than others and used for archival data and cab be accessed slowly might takes minutes to hours

18. Set the lifecycle rules to move data to glacier using prefix and period like /logs and 180days of obj creation

19. Initiate retreival request to retrieve the data stored in glacier through console or API ,while retrieving AWS copy the glacier data into RRS and provide temporary copy and you can mention the time for which you want that data to be in RRS.

20. Three option for Glacier Retrieval : Expedited(1-5min) , standard (3-5 hours) ,Bulk(5-12 hours)

21. $0.004 per gb/mont for glacier storage and transition to Glacier ($0.05 /1000request) and minumium 90 days for Glacier.

22. 10 Gb retrieval is free

23. If you delete 1 gb of data from glacier in 1st month out of 3 then you have to pay remaining 2 month of glacier storage price for 1 gb

24. Retrieval cost from glacier is 0.03 per gb and 0.01 per request,0.01 gb and 0.05 per 1000 requet ,0.0025 per Gb and 0.025 per 1000 request

25. Yes you can host static websites on s3 on low cost ,highly available,scable solution

26. Yes you can Tap your domain name to you bucket

27. You can redirect to other url or using bookmarks to old page or using policy

28. No additional charge only storage ,request and data transfer

29. Objects Tags (key values ) can be used for IAM and lifecycle policies and customize metric storage

30. You can add upto 10 tags to s3 object while creating or later

31. Outside AWS console all the tags need to add in set example if you have added 5 tags and want to add 6th ,you have to mention all five

32. $0.01 per 10000 tags per month

33. Storage Analytics or Storage class analysis automatically define the patterns and identify the right storage class foe right data . Later you can create lifecycle policy using that data

34. Use S3 put bucket analysis API to configure a storage class analysis .you can navigate to AWS Management console ,management tab to manage s3 analytics ,s3 inventory,s3 cloud metrics

35. S3 analytics happen daily an you can export analysis data on your bucket for further checks

36. S3 inventory is alternative for S3 sync list Api which will provide the .csv or ORC file containing the output of your obj and metadata

37. You can use s3 put bucket api to configure the daily and weekly inventory for all the obj or prefix and mention the destination bucket where .csv or ORC and metadata like size ,modified at a etc will be stored

38. You can encrypt inventory using SSE -S3 ,SSE -KMS

39. You can s3 inventory as direct input to your app or also query

40. You can set lifecycle policy to reduce cost the cost of storage ,it mover obj from one class to another .Also delete the obj if it is not required depends upon the days you give. Also Delete the multiple part expiration files

41. Life cycle object applies to existing objects and new object which will come

42. Cross region replication is to replicate object ,there ACL and metadata to destination bucket in the region. To provide low latency data access in the different region

43. Versioning must be on while using CORS

44. CORS is bucket level configuration you can enable by giving destination bucket

45. Use s3 copy for previous data before CORS

46. You can mention the subset to replication suing prefix

47. Yes you can replicate the encrypted data by mentioning the Key in the configuration

48. Transfer Accelararion can help in transfer data fast for long distance using cloud front edge location

49. Nickname.s3-accelarate.awsamozon.com or backutname.s3-accrete.dulstack.awaamaazon.com

50. Fast depends on bandwidth ,packet loss and distance

51. Accelreate is secure are Over TCP and can restrict IP

52. S3 acceleration is giving throuput and TCP it is better than cloud front if you have data < 5 gb then use put/post commands

53. Snowball is idea for customer transferring batch at once and 5-7 days turnaround.Tranfer acceleration can use 1 gb bandwidth and upload 75 TB of Data if possible than this is better.

54. Other option is perform initial heavy lift using snowball and use transfer acc later

55. AWS Direct Connect is for customer having private network ,Tranfer acc is best for all from diff loc over public internet where variable network condition make throughput poor. Some Aws direct customer use transfer acc where internet speed is slow

56. Gateways that connect directly to s3 can tae advantages of transfer acc

57. S3 support ipv6 ,use dual stack endpoints which supports both 6 and 4
